# Hello! Iâ€™m @michaelpineirocode  
### Here's a little about me:   
Iâ€™m interested in all things programming! I find approaching new and challenging problems most engaging.  
Iâ€™m currently learning the software design of additive manufacturing.  
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my lithophane repository! Any questions, comments, or suggestions are also greatly appreciated!  
ðŸ“« You can reach me via my email at michaelpineiro.code@gmail.com!
